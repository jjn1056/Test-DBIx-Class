=head1 NAME

Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager::Trait::SQLite - The Default Role

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The default Storage trait which provides the ability to deploy to a SQLite
database.  It also sets some %ENV and or configuration options that you can
use to specify alternative database setup.

In addition to the documented %ENV settings, this Trait adds the following:

=over 4

=item DBNAME

Defaults to ':memory:' to create an in memory database.  Provide a string
suitable for the "dbname=XXX" part of your connect string.  Typically this
should be the path to a location on the filesystem you want the datbase file
to be stored.

Please note that this file will automatically be deleted unless you have
specified to 'keep_db' in the config or via the $ENV{KEEP_DB} setting.

Also note that if you specify a path that already exists, we will automatically
add the option 'force_drop_table', on the assumption you are roundtripping
tests to the same database file.  This way you can avoid having to specifically
tell the system to delete the file each time.
